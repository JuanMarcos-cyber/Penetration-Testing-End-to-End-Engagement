# Penetration-Testing-End-to-End-Engagement

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents a full penetration testing engagement performed in a controlled environment (DVWA), covering the complete lifecycle from reconnaissance to reporting..

The assessment was performed in a **controlled lab environment**  using a deliberately vulnerable web application (DVWA).

The project follows a **real-world penetration testing lifecycle**.

It covers:
- Reconnaissance  
- Enumeration  
- Exploitation  
- Post-exploitation  
- Reporting and remediation  


Special emphasis is placed on:
- Risk identification  
- Business impact  
- Clear and structured communication  

The goal is not only to find vulnerabilities,  but to **explain why they matter**  and **how they should be fixed**.


> ⚠️ All activities were conducted in an **authorized lab environment**  for **educational purposes only**.
