# 05 – Exploitation Phase
========================

## Objective

The objective of this phase was to document how the vulnerabilities identified
and validated during Phase 04 were operationally exploited using standard
attacker tooling and workflows.

This phase focuses on *how* exploitation was carried out (tool usage, request
manipulation, and attacker decision-making), rather than revalidating
individual vulnerabilities or payloads already documented.

---

## Environment and Tools

- Target Application: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- Environment: Local laboratory environment (localhost)
- Security Level: Low
- Tools Used:
  - DIRB
  - Burp Suite Community Edition
  - Mozilla Firefox

---

## Directory Enumeration with DIRB

### Purpose

DIRB was used to perform directory and file enumeration in order to identify
accessible resources, misconfigurations, and exposed files that could assist
an attacker during exploitation.

This step simulates a common attacker technique to reduce uncertainty about
the target application's structure prior to exploitation.

---

### DIRB Execution

The following command was executed against the DVWA instance:

```bash
dirb http://localhost:8080/
```

The default DIRB wordlist (common.txt) was used to simulate a realistic
baseline enumeration scenario.

### DIRB Results (Extract)

The scan identified multiple exposed directories and files:

```bash
==> DIRECTORY: http://localhost:8080/config/
==> DIRECTORY: http://localhost:8080/docs/
==> DIRECTORY: http://localhost:8080/external/
+ http://localhost:8080/php.ini (CODE:200|SIZE:148)
+ http://localhost:8080/phpinfo.php (CODE:302|SIZE:0)
+ http://localhost:8080/robots.txt (CODE:200|SIZE:26)
+ http://localhost:8080/server-status (CODE:403|SIZE:299)
```

Several directories were flagged as listable, as shown in the scan output:


(!) WARNING: Directory IS LISTABLE. No need to scan it.

## Impact of DIRB Findings

Although directory enumeration does not constitute exploitation by itself,
these findings provided valuable intelligence by:

- Revealing application structure  
- Identifying potentially sensitive configuration files  
- Highlighting misconfigured directory permissions  
- Guiding attacker focus toward high-value endpoints  

This information directly supports the exploitation activities documented in
this phase and the vulnerabilities validated in Phase 04.

## Exploitation Workflow Using Burp Suite

### Role of Burp Suite

Burp Suite Community Edition was used as the primary tool to manually exploit
the previously identified vulnerabilities by manipulating HTTP requests sent
to the application.

This approach reflects a realistic attacker workflow that does not rely on
fully automated exploitation frameworks.

---

### Request Interception (Proxy)

Burp Suite Proxy was configured in the browser to intercept HTTP traffic
between Mozilla Firefox and the DVWA application.

Intercepted requests allowed inspection of:

- Request method (GET / POST)  
- URL paths and parameters  
- User-controlled input fields  
- Cookies and session parameters  

This step enabled identification of parameters suitable for manipulation.

### Request Manipulation (Repeater)

Captured requests were forwarded to Burp Suite Repeater, where parameters
could be modified and replayed manually.

The Repeater functionality was used to:

- Modify user-supplied parameters  
- Replay requests multiple times  
- Observe differences in server responses  
- Confirm application behavior under manipulated input  

This iterative process allowed precise control over exploitation attempts and
clear observation of server-side processing.

## Observed Results

Using Burp Suite Repeater, modified requests resulted in:

- Application logic being bypassed  
- Unauthorized data being returned in responses  
- Clear differences between normal and manipulated responses  

These results confirmed that the vulnerabilities identified in Phase 04 were
not theoretical and could be reliably exploited using manual techniques.

---

## Relationship to Phase 04 Findings

The following vulnerability categories were exploited using the workflow
described above and are fully documented in Phase 04:

- SQL Injection  
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)  
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Command Injection  

This phase does not duplicate payloads, screenshots, or results already
presented in Phase 04. Instead, it demonstrates how directory enumeration and
manual request manipulation enable practical exploitation of those findings.

---

## Scope Limitations for This Phase

The following activities were intentionally excluded, as they fall under
post-exploitation and were outside the objective of this phase:

- Password cracking  
- Privilege escalation  
- Persistence mechanisms  
- Lateral movement  

---

## Overall Exploitation Impact

The exploitation workflow demonstrates that the identified vulnerabilities can
be operationalized using commonly available tools and minimal attacker effort.

In a real-world environment, the same workflow could lead to:

- Application compromise  
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data  
- Increased attack surface due to misconfiguration  
- Significant business and compliance risk  

---

## Conclusion

Phase 05 demonstrates how attackers transition from vulnerability discovery to
practical exploitation by combining enumeration (DIRB) and manual HTTP request
manipulation (Burp Suite).

This phase reinforces the severity of the findings documented in Phase 04 and
highlights the importance of layered defenses to prevent real-world attacks.
