# 05 – Exploitation Phase
========================

## Objective

The objective of this phase was to validate the practical exploitability of the
vulnerabilities identified during the assessment phase by actively exploiting
them in a controlled laboratory environment.

The purpose of exploitation was limited to confirming real attack impact and
did not include post-exploitation activities.

---

## Environment and Tools

- Target Application: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- Environment: Local laboratory environment (localhost)
- Security Level: Low
- Tools Used:
  - Burp Suite Community Edition
  - Mozilla Firefox

---

## Reconnaissance Context Supporting Exploitation

Prior reconnaissance activities identified several exposed directories and
files that could assist an attacker during exploitation.

The following resources were discovered to be accessible:

- `/config/`
- `/docs/`
- `/external/`
- `/php.ini`
- `/phpinfo.php`
- `/robots.txt`

Some directories were confirmed to be listable, indicating insufficient access
controls and increasing the risk of information disclosure.

---

## Exploitation Methodology

Exploitation was performed manually using **Burp Suite Community Edition**.

The following Burp Suite components were used:

- **Proxy**: to intercept HTTP requests sent from the browser to the DVWA
  application.
- **Repeater**: to manually modify and resend HTTP requests containing crafted
  input parameters.

This methodology allowed precise control over request manipulation and direct
observation of server responses, closely simulating a real attacker workflow.

---

## SQL Injection Exploitation

### Description

The SQL Injection vulnerability was exploited by manipulating the `id`
parameter in HTTP GET requests sent to the vulnerable SQL Injection endpoint.

The application failed to properly validate user input, allowing injected SQL
logic to be processed by the backend database.

---

### Exploitation Process

1. A legitimate request was intercepted using Burp Suite Proxy.
2. The request was sent to Burp Suite Repeater.
3. The `id` parameter was modified to include SQL injection payloads.
4. The modified request was resent to the server.

---

### Results

The server response confirmed successful exploitation:

- Authentication logic was bypassed
- Multiple user records were returned
- No valid credentials were required

User information (first name and surname) was displayed in the application
response, demonstrating unauthorized database access.

---

### Impact

Successful SQL Injection exploitation enables an attacker to:

- Bypass application logic
- Access backend database records
- Compromise confidentiality of stored data
- Undermine trust in authentication mechanisms

These outcomes align with the critical risk rating assigned during the
assessment phase.

---

## Exploitable Vulnerability Categories

At the configured Low security level, the following vulnerability classes were
confirmed exploitable:

- Command Injection
- SQL Injection
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Cross-Site Scripting (Stored)

These vulnerabilities exist due to missing or insufficient server-side input
validation and security controls.

---

## Scope Limitations for This Phase

The following activities were intentionally not performed during this phase, as
the objective was limited to validating initial exploitability and impact:

- Password cracking
- Privilege escalation
- Persistence mechanisms
- Lateral movement

These activities fall under post-exploitation and were outside the defined
scope of this phase.

---

## Overall Exploitation Impact

The exploitation phase confirmed that multiple high-risk and critical
vulnerabilities are practically exploitable using standard tools and minimal
attacker effort.

In a production environment, such weaknesses could result in unauthorized
access to sensitive data, application compromise, and significant business and
compliance impact.

---

## Conclusion

This phase demonstrated that the vulnerabilities identified during the
assessment phase are not theoretical but exploitable in practice.

The use of Burp Suite Community Edition highlighted how an attacker can
manipulate HTTP requests to reliably exploit application weaknesses.

Immediate remediation and security hardening are required before deployment in
any real-world environment.
