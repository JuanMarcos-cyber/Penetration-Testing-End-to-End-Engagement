# Penetration-Testing-End-to-End-Engagement

## Overview

This repository documents a **full end-to-end penetration testing engagement**
performed in a **controlled laboratory environment** using the
**Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**.

The project follows a **real-world penetration testing lifecycle**,
from initial authorization and reconnaissance through exploitation,
post-exploitation, and final reporting.

The objective is not only to identify vulnerabilities,
but to clearly explain **why they matter**, **their potential impact**,
and **how they should be remediated**.

---

## Engagement Phases

The assessment is structured into **seven distinct phases**,
each documented separately to reflect professional penetration testing practices.

### 01 – Pre-Engagement & Authorization

Definition of scope, rules of engagement, technical readiness,
and safety controls before any active testing begins.

Focus:
- Authorization
- Scope definition
- Risk management
- Evidence and reporting preparation

---

### 02 – Information Gathering & Reconnaissance

Discovery and mapping of the target application without exploitation.

Focus:
- Application mapping
- Endpoint and directory discovery
- Technology and header analysis
- Passive and active reconnaissance

---

### 03 – Threat Modeling

Analysis of the identified attack surface to understand
potential attack paths and high-risk areas.

Focus:
- Attack surface analysis
- Trust boundaries
- Threat identification
- Potential attacker objectives

---

### 04 – Vulnerability Assessment

Identification and validation of vulnerabilities present
in the application without full impact exploitation.

Focus:
- Vulnerability identification
- Severity assessment
- Risk evaluation
- Evidence collection

---

### 05 – Exploitation

Controlled exploitation of identified vulnerabilities
to demonstrate real-world impact.

Focus:
- Proof-of-concept exploitation
- Payload execution
- Data exposure validation
- Command execution where applicable

---

### 06 – Post-Exploitation

Analysis of what an attacker could achieve after initial access.

Focus:
- Privilege context
- Data access and disclosure
- Attack chaining
- Potential lateral movement (within scope)

---

### 07 – Reporting & Remediation

Clear communication of findings and actionable remediation guidance.

Focus:
- Executive summary
- Technical reporting
- Business impact
- Remediation planning
- Lessons learned

---

## Key Principles

- Risk-based approach
- Clear and structured communication
- Evidence-driven findings
- Business impact awareness
- Professional reporting standards
